					<h2>What are Smart Cities?</h2>
					<p>Smart Cities are urban areas where, thanks to digital technologies, it's possible to improve the infrastructures and services to citizens making them more efficient. The definition of Smart City starts from the digital transformation and the use of the IoT (Internet of Things) that, in short, describes physical objects (even daily ones) with processing abilities, like a computer.<br>
					In this case we're talking about smart cities, which is a much wider concept, in fact, other than smart, the city must be sustainable, efficient and innovative.</p>

				<p>One of the most famous smart cities in Europe is Amsterdam, invoked for decades as a symbol of "alternative mobility" and as an example to follow. Thanks to the choices made by the local government, citizens have been accustomed to using non-polluting energy sources, and for this reason alternatives. For example, increasing the use of means of transport such as scooters, bicycles etc. creating easily accessible cycle paths. For this reason the Dutch city can be considered a champion of the "energy transition".</p>
